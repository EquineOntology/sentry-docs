## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/svelte

# Using npm
npm install --save @sentry/svelte
```

## Configure

Initialize Sentry as early as possible in your application's lifecycle, usually your Svelte app's entry point (`main.ts/js`):

```javascript
import "./app.css";
import App from "./App.svelte";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/svelte";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Sentry.Replay()],
  // Session Replay
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1, // This sets the sample rate at 10%. You may want to change it to 100% while in development and then sample at a lower rate in production.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0, // If you're not already sampling the entire session, change the sample rate to 100% when sampling sessions where errors occur.
});

const app = new App({
  target: document.getElementById("app"),
});

export default app;
```

## Verify

This snippet contains an intentional error and can be used as a test to make sure that everything's working as expected.

```html
// SomeComponent.svelte

<button type="button" on:click="{unknownFunction}">
  Throw error
</button>
```
