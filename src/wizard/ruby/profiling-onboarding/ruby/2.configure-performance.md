#### Configure Performance

Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product has to be enabled in order for Profiling to work. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

```ruby
# config/initializers/sentry.rb

Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___'
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
end
```
